<p>Measures 2-1/4 x 2-7/8 x 3-7/8 inches, makes a picture 1-1/2 x 2 inches,
and weighs only 5 ounces. Delivered ready for 12 exposures without
reloading.</p>

<p>The Lens is of the fixed focus type, and of sufficient length of focus
(2-1/2 inches) to avoid distortion.</p>

<p>Has improved rotary shutter and set of three stops for lens. The slides
for changing stops and for time exposures are alongside of the exposure
lever and always show by their position what stop is before the lens and
whether the shutter is set for time or instantaneous exposures, thus
acting as a warning.</p>

<p>In the <i>quality</i> of the work they will do, Pocket Kodaks equal the best
cameras on the market. They make negatives of such perfect quality that
enlargements of any size can be made from them.</p>

<p>The Pocket Kodaks are covered with fine leather, and the trimmings are
handsomely finished and lacquered. They are elegant, artistic, and
durable.</p>

<p>I have examined the publication "The Great Round World". It seems to me
to be admirable in its design and also in its execution. It abandons the
formal style of the newspaper in the narration of events, substituting
instead a style that is at once conversational and free. I commend it to

<p>&quot;I would advise <b>Sunday-school teachers</b> to use, in connection with the
lessons of 1897, <b>Klemm's Relief Map of the Roman Empire</b>. Every scholar
who can draw should have a copy of it. Being blank, it can be beautifully
colored: waters, blue; mountains, brown; valleys, green; deserts, yellow;
cities marked with pin-holes; and the journeys of Paul can be traced upon
it.&quot;&mdash;<span class='smcap'>Mrs. Wilbur F. Crafts</span>, <i>President International Union of

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p class='center'><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE MAPS.</b></p>

<p>These maps are made in two forms, both with beautifully executed relief
(embossed)&mdash;the cheaper ones of plain stiff paper similar to drawing paper
(these are to be substituted for and used as outline map blanks), the
others covered with a durable waterproof surface, that can be quickly
cleaned with a damp sponge, adapted to receive a succession of markings
and cleansings. Oceans, lakes, and rivers, as well as land, appear in the
same color, white, so as to facilitate the use of the map as a
<b><i>geographical slate</i></b>.</p>

<p>The troubles between Turkey and Greece do not show any signs of reaching
a peaceful settlement. In fact, from the news this week, the Powers seem
to be growing angrier as the days go by.</p>

<p>England has boldly declared that she will never allow Thessaly to be
placed under Turkish rule again.</p>

<p>It is said that the British Ambassador, Sir Philip Currie, told this to
Tewfik Pasha, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the presence
of Monsieur Nelidoff, the Russian Ambassador.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Currie is reported to have stated the decision of his
Government in such very determined words, that both the Turkish and
Russian Ministers were speechless with surprise. Tewfik Pasha listened
in silence, while the Englishman announced that unless Turkey gave back
Thessaly to Greece, Great Britain would withdraw from the concert of the
Powers. The Turkish Minister could not conceal his surprise and dismay,
but left the room without making any reply, the Russian Minister
following him.</p>

<p>A few days later the Turkish Cabinet met in council, and after a very
long discussion they decided that <a name="Page_956" id="Page_956"></a>under the circumstances it was
impossible for Turkey to leave Thessaly, and that, as Turkey is in
possession of Thessaly, and able to wait patiently while the terms of
peace are being arranged, there is no need to take any immediate steps
in the matter.</p>

<p>The council decided to continue preparations for war, so that, if terms
of peace cannot be arranged, Turkey will be ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>The next time Tewfik Pasha met the Ambassadors after his conversation
with Sir Philip Currie, he was able to say that his Government would not
give up Thessaly.</p>

<p>The Powers made answer that Thessaly must be given up, and that the
Turks must retire to their own side of the frontier immediately.</p>

<p>Finding that the Powers remained firm, the Sultan ventured on an act so
bold and astonishing, that Europe has not yet recovered from it.</p>

<p>He appealed to the Czar of Russia and the Emperor of Germany, asking
them to help him in his efforts to make Thessaly a part of the Ottoman
Empire.</p>

<p>The other ambassadors were most indignant when they learned of the
Sultan's action, and one and all refused to consider any further the
treaty of peace, until the question of the Turks leaving Thessaly had
been settled.</p>

<p>After the news of Turkey's appeal reached them, a meeting, which lasted
four hours, was held by the diplomats, but the result of this conference
was not made public.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone has written a very bitter letter against Turkey, in which
he again refers to the Sultan as the Grand Assassin.</p><p><a name="Page_957" id="Page_957"></a></p>

<p>He is said to have stated in his letter that he should not be surprised
if the Sultan had the audacity to send representatives to the Queen's
Jubilee; and to have added that he hoped the British Government would
prevent any such thing, as the Turkish envoys might meet with a
reception that would not be agreeable to them.</p>

<p>This cannot be true, for so great a man as Gladstone would not stoop to
rousing his countrymen to riotous and discourteous acts. Should the
Sultan send over envoys to honor the Queen, they will be the nation's
guests, and as such should be treated with respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone is such a fine old man, that we are sure that this report
will be proved false.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is a report that the Sultan has broken the armistice, by sending
fresh troops into Thessaly and continuing to fortify the towns of Volo
and Prevesa.</p>

<p>Word has also reached us that the Governor of Volo has issued a
proclamation, ordering the people who ran away from the town when the
Turks entered it to return. Unless these people go back within two
weeks, all the property they left behind them will be seized and
confiscated by the Turks.</p>

<p>The unfortunate inhabitants of Thessaly seem to be having a very hard
time of it. It is said that the province is full of brigands, and that
many people who fled to the mountains to avoid the Turks have been
seized by these vagabonds and held for ransom.</p>

<p>For years Greece was a very unsafe place for travellers on account of
robbers.</p>

<p>In the days before railways, when people had to <a name="Page_958" id="Page_958"></a>travel by coach,
brigands infested most of the mountains and forests in Europe.</p>

<p>It was their habit to keep a regular lookout for travellers, and, as
soon as they approached, rush out upon them and rob them. If any
important person happened to be in the party, the brigands would make
him captive and hold him until his friends paid a large sum for his
freedom.</p>

<p>Brigandage has lingered longer in Greece than elsewhere, because there
are fewer railroads in that country.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is little likelihood of decided action on Cuban affairs for the
present.</p>

<p>It is evident that President McKinley does not mean to do anything rash
in this matter.</p>

<p>He is reported to have said that he thinks the subject should be
considered with the greatest care, and that no hasty conclusions should
be arrived at.</p>

<p>There is a report that he intends to outline his Cuban policy, and then
entrust it to the new Minister to Spain. Much thought has been exercised
in choosing this official, the President having finally nominated Gen.
Stewart L. Woodford for the important mission. It is thought that
nothing will be done in regard to Cuba until after General Woodford
arrives in Madrid.</p>

<p>The President has received Mr. Calhoun's report, and from the statements
which this gentleman made on his return it would seem impossible any
longer to deny that actual warfare is being carried on in Cuba.</p>

<p>When Mr. Calhoun was questioned on the subject, he replied:</p>

<p>"War is going on in the island. True, no great <a name="Page_959" id="Page_959"></a>battles are being
fought, no Gettysburgs or Chickamaugas, but there is war nevertheless."</p>

<p>He was asked if he thought the war would soon be over. He said he could
not form any idea about it; all he knew was that a very cruel war was
going on, and that both sides were doing their best to ruin the country.</p>

<p>Some people who profess to know say that any action taken by the United
States will be in the line of home rule for Cuba. The President
questioned Mr. Calhoun very closely as to the possibility of the Cubans
accepting home rule, and Mr. Calhoun replied that he thought the Cubans
generally would be in favor of such a measure.</p>

<p>Spain is thought to be willing to agree to some arrangement of this
character. The rebellion in Cuba is costing her between eight and ten
million dollars a month, and it is supposed that she will be willing to
get out of her difficulties if she can find a way.</p>

<p>The stumbling-block in the way of home rule is that there has been
created a debt of many million dollars as a result of the war. If Spain
does not make the payment of this enormous sum of money by Cuba the
condition of granting home rule, the matter may soon be arranged. Should
Spain insist on the payment of this money, Cuba will have to fight until
the end, for it is quite impossible for her to meet any such demand.</p>

<p>There are reports that General Weyler will be recalled to Spain. Some
say that he has already been ordered home; others that he has sent in
his resignation, but that the Queen Regent will not accept it until she
sees what the United States is going to do. If <a name="Page_960" id="Page_960"></a>trouble should come with
this country she will probably keep Weyler in Cuba.</p>

<p>There is now a very strong party in Madrid which demands the removal of
Weyler.</p>

<p>There was some excitement when the news reached this country that Gen.
Rius Rivera was to be shot. The news came from Havana, and roused a
storm of indignant protests against such a shameful practice as shooting
a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>The Spanish newspapers have been saying very unkind things about us
since the Senate passed the Morgan resolutions, but in spite of this it
would seem that Spain is really anxious to keep our good will. No sooner
did the report about General Rivera reach us, than Se&ntilde;or Dupuy de L&ocirc;me
made full inquiries into the matter, and sent word to his Government
that the reports were absolutely false, and that the authorities had no
intention of shooting General Rivera.</p>

<p>In regard to the Ruiz matter, it is said that our Government will claim
that Spain is responsible for the doctor's death, whether he died from
injuries received in the prison or not, because they kept him shut up,
without the privilege of communicating with anybody, ten days longer
than the law permits.</p>

<p>It is expected that our Government will claim $150,000 damages for Mrs.
Ruiz and her children, and will demand that Fondeviella, who was in
charge of the jail, shall be punished for keeping the unfortunate man in
this close confinement for three hundred and fifteen hours, instead of
the seventy-two hours named in their law.</p>

<p>The authorities in Madrid are beginning to think that too many Cubans
are claiming the protection of American <a name="Page_961" id="Page_961"></a>citizenship, to save themselves
from punishment.</p>

<p>When Dr. Ruiz was arrested, he claimed American citizenship, and it was
on account of this claim that General Lee became interested in his case.</p>

<p>By referring to page 473 of <span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span>, you will see
that Dr. Ruiz was born in Cuba, came to the United States to study,
became naturalized, and then went back again to Cuba, where he entered
into business as a dentist. His case was so complicated, that the
authorities in Cuba thought they had good ground for disbelieving him
when he claimed to be a citizen of the United States.</p>

<p>To avoid any such trouble in future, Spain has proposed to make a new
naturalization treaty with us. The terms of this treaty will cover just
such cases as that of Dr. Ruiz.</p>

<p>One of the articles provides that any Cuban, or other Spanish-born
subject, who becomes naturalized in this country, and then goes back to
live in Cuba or the land of his birth, will, after two years' residence
in the country in which he was born, be once more regarded as a Spanish
subject, and must waive his naturalization rights.</p>

<p>If, however, at the end of the two years, he declares his intention to
go back and live in his adopted country, he will be allowed to do so,
and his naturalization will hold good.</p>

<p>Our Government is in favor of accepting this treaty, because it will
save the consuls much trouble and avoid many squabbles between the two
governments.</p>

<p>The <i>Dauntless</i> has been on trial for filibustering,<a name="Page_962" id="Page_962"></a> and released, no
arms or suspicious cargo having been found in her.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that the <i>Dauntless</i> did not deserve her good
fortune. If the reports be true, the day after her release from custody
she took on a large cargo of war material, and made off for Cuba with
thirty-five volunteers on board.</p>

<p>In her cargo she is said to have carried three hundred rounds of
ammunition for the famous dynamite-gun, so it is to be supposed that the
terrible weapon is once more in working order.</p>

<p>A large expedition landed in Santa Clara the other day.</p>

<p>The report says that the cargo was unloaded in the face of a force of
Spanish coast-guards, who had sighted the vessel and hurried to the
shore to capture the expedition. A gunboat was sent round to cut the
filibuster off by sea, while the coast-guard did the work on land. The
Cubans, however, beat off both their foes and landed the cargo safely.</p>

<p>News of a battle near Havana has been telegraphed to Key West, but the
press censor has forbidden the details to be published. For this reason
it is believed to have been a Cuban victory, with heavy losses on the
Spanish side.</p>

<p>There is some very important news about Hawaii this week.</p>

<p>A treaty, whereby Hawaii is to be annexed to the United States, has been
prepared, approved by the President, signed by the representatives of
both governments, and sent to the Senate for consideration.</p>

<p>The way it all came about was this.</p><p><a name="Page_963" id="Page_963"></a></p>

<p>We have been telling you from week to week about the angry feeling that
has been growing between Hawaii and Japan.</p>

<p>Last week we told you how threatening the Japanese Minister had become,
and that he hinted that diplomatic relations between the two countries
would be severed.</p>

<p>The Hawaiian Government became very much alarmed at this, and the two
gentlemen who had been sent to the United States to try and bring about
the annexation were instructed to go once more to our Government and beg
that something be done before it was too late.</p>

<p><i>Annexing</i> means joining to. You know what an annex to a house is&mdash;that
it is a few extra rooms built beside the house, and joined permanently
to it. When one country annexes another it makes it part of itself. The
new lands are permanently joined to the old, and are regarded as a part
of the whole.</p>

<p>President McKinley has expressed himself as in favor of annexing Hawaii,
and has been considering the matter for some time. He did not wish that
anything should interfere with the Tariff Bill, and for this reason kept
Hawaiian matters in the background, along with Cuban affairs, until the
Tariff question should be settled.</p>

<p>The trouble with Japan has forced him to consider Hawaiian Annexation
before he intended to, and so the treaty has been drawn up.</p>

<p>He is more willing to give the matter his attention at the present time,
because he finds that Hawaiian affairs are really delaying the Tariff
Bill.</p>

<p>A great deal of our sugar is imported from <a name="Page_964" id="Page_964"></a>the Hawaiian Islands, and
under a commercial treaty made between Hawaii and the United States this
sugar is brought into our country free of duty.</p>

<p>There is a clause in the treaty which says that the President can
terminate it whenever he wishes to, by giving due notice.</p>

<p>In considering the sugar tariff, it was necessary for the Senators to
decide whether Hawaiian sugar should still be admitted free of charge,
or should be subject to the same duties as other sugars.</p>

<p>The Senators could not come to any agreement until they knew whether the
President meant to end the treaty&mdash;abrogate it, as it is called.</p>

<p>Not wishing to delay the Tariff Bill, the President thought the wisest
thing to do would be to let the Senate know that he was in favor of
annexing Hawaii.</p>

<p>With Hawaii a part of this country, the sugar question would settle
itself, and the Tariff Bill could go on undisturbed.</p>

<p>Before the President allowed any word of his intentions to become known,
he called a Cabinet meeting and laid the treaty before his ministers.</p>

<p>The majority of the Cabinet approved of the draft of the treaty that was
read to them, and it is thought that the Senate will also look favorably
on the measure, and that the necessary two-thirds vote will be secured
without trouble.</p>

<p>The treaty provides that the United States shall become possessed of all
the public lands and buildings, ships, ports, etc., belonging to Hawaii,
and shall in return assume Hawaii's debts, which amount to $4,000,000.</p>

<p>This treaty does not provide any pension for the ex-<a name="Page_965" id="Page_965"></a>queen,
Liliuokalani, nor any gift of money for the Princess Kiaulani.</p>

<p>The treaty proposed in 1893, which was rejected by Mr. Cleveland,
provided liberally for both. You can read all about it on page 734 of
<span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span>.</p>

<p>Queen Liliuokalani is not at all disturbed by the talk of annexation.
She has been in Washington all the winter, trying to make friends of the
Senators, so that they will oppose the treaty when it is brought before
them.</p>

<p>It is said that she is perfectly serene and happy in the belief that she
has enough influence in the Senate to prevent the bill from being
passed.</p>

<p>The Committee of Inquiry into the Transvaal Raid has finished its work.</p>

<p>In the course of the inquiry certain cablegrams were mentioned, which
had been sent by Cecil Rhodes to some persons in England.</p>

<p>In courts of law you cannot quote from a book, letter, or telegram,
unless you produce the actual paper you quote from, and thus prove to
the satisfaction of the court that the book, letter, or telegram really
exists.</p>

<p>When reference was made to these telegrams, the Committee asked to see
them, but they were not forthcoming. Every one supposed that an order
would be issued for the production of these messages, but, strange to
say, no such order was given.</p>

<p>People began to be suspicious, and it was whispered that these messages
contained information that the Committee dared not make public.</p><p><a name="Page_966" id="Page_966"></a></p>

<p>At first, the worst that people suspected was that they would show that
Mr. Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, had known all about the
preparations for the Jameson Raid, and that he and Mr. Cecil Rhodes had
planned to seize the Transvaal, with its rich gold-fields, and annex it
to the English Colonies in South Africa.</p>

<p>Had this been the truth, it would have been bad enough. Mr. Chamberlain
was one of the Queen's Ministers, bound to obey the laws and uphold
them. That he should have been aware that an attempt was to be made to
steal the country of a friendly power, without making an effort to
prevent it, would have been disgraceful enough.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it appears that the blame falls on a personage in much
higher position than Mr. Chamberlain.</p>

<p>It is said that no less a person than the Prince of Wales is named in
these cablegrams as one of the men who knew all about the preparations
for the Raid, and was perfectly willing that they should be carried out.
Several other men in high positions in England were also in the plot to
seize the Transvaal. (For the story of the plot, see <span class="smcap">The Great Round
World</span>, pages 513 and 667.)</p>

<p>The cablegrams were at one time in the possession of Mr. Chamberlain,
having been given him by Mr. Cecil Rhodes, in the hope that the names of
the men interested in the plot would make him use his influence to
prevent any inquiry being made into the Raid.</p>

<p>London is shocked and indignant at these rumors, and insists that the
cablegrams shall be produced and <a name="Page_967" id="Page_967"></a>the truth known about the Prince of
Wales' connection with the matter.</p>

<p>The Committee of Inquiry has, however, decided not to press the demand
for the messages, and so the whole affair will be hushed up as far as
possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain was called before the Committee, and said, in regard to
the cablegrams, that he had personally not the slightest objection to
their being produced, but that they were unfortunately no longer in his
possession. As far as he knew they were now in the keeping of the lawyer
for the British South African Company.</p>

<p>Legal proceedings are being taken against this lawyer, to make him give
the papers up.</p>

<p>The Committee, after hearing Mr. Chamberlain's evidence, said that the
inquiry was at an end as far as they were concerned, but that they would
report the refusal to give up the missing cablegrams to the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>The chances are that this is the last that will ever be heard about the
inquiry into the Jameson Raid.</p>

<p>It has long been suspected that some people in very high position were
connected with this very disgraceful affair. One reason for the
supposition was that when Dr. Jameson was first put on trial for leading
the raid, it was whispered about that he would not be punished very
severely, as he had powerful friends in high quarters, who were bound to
protect him.</p>

<p>When he and his officers were sentenced to imprisonment in Holloway
jail, the rumors died out. They revived again as one man after another
was released from jail before his time was up. The various excuses
offered were so flimsy that the public began to think <a name="Page_968" id="Page_968"></a>that it was true
that they had powerful friends protecting them.</p>

<p>All honest Englishmen are feeling shocked that those who ought to be so
far above the greed of gain have let their honor be trampled in the mire
for the sake of the Johannesburg gold-mines.</p>

<p>There is, however, one gleam of sunshine in the midst of the gloom. It
seems that Dr. Leyds, who was sent over from the Transvaal to arrange
this unhappy affair, has had several satisfactory interviews with Mr.
Chamberlain, and will take back to Oom Paul a proposal from England for
the settlement of the troubles.</p>

<p>It is said that the offer made by Mr. Chamberlain is one that will find
favor both in England and Africa, and that there is every prospect of
the matter being peacefully settled.</p>

<p>Oom Paul, despite the wrong done him by England, has ordered that the
day of the Queen's Jubilee shall be observed throughout the South
African Republic as a special holiday.</p>

<p>He is certainly a very noble, generous-spirited old man.</p>

<p>We have a good deal to tell you about treaties this week.</p>

<p>The treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela, which was arranged by
the United States, has been agreed to by both governments, and now the
dispute over the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana will
be settled by arbitration instead of war.</p>

<p>You will find all about the treaty on pages 52, 196, and 306 of <span class="smcap">The
Great Round World</span>.</p><p><a name="Page_969" id="Page_969"></a></p>

<p>You remember that copies of the treaty were sent by the British Minister
and the Minister from Venezuela to their respective governments for
approval.</p>

<p>Both countries were satisfied with the treaty, and on the 14th of June,
Sir Julian Pauncefote, representing England, and Se&ntilde;or Jos&eacute; Andr&aacute;de, for
Venezuela, met and exchanged the notes of approval from their
governments.</p>

<p>There will be five members of the Arbitration Committee&mdash;Baron Herschel
and Sir Richard Collins for England, and Chief-Justice Fuller and
Justice Brewer for Venezuela.</p>

<p>As in the case of the proposed Arbitration with England, the King of
Sweden may nominate the odd man on the Committee. The two sides are to
try and agree on a fifth person to act with them, and if they fail to
agree the King of Sweden is to have the right to name him.</p>

<p>The Arbitrators are to meet in Paris, and must render a decision within
three months after both sides have stated their case.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago we told you about Ellis Island, and the way immigrants
were received and handled there.</p>

<p>You will be sorry to learn that the whole of the government buildings on
Ellis Island have been destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>No one knows how the accident happened, but just after midnight a
watchman noticed smoke coming out of one of the rooms, and gave the
alarm of fire.</p>

<p>There were more than a hundred immigrants on the island, as well as a
large force of people to care for <a name="Page_970" id="Page_970"></a>them. In addition to these people,
there were some fifty patients in the hospital. In all, there were two
hundred and thirteen people in the buildings when the fire started, but
the discipline was so perfect, and the employees of the Island were so
well trained, that not a single person was injured.</p>

<p>The patients from the hospital were removed from the wards in quick
time, taken on boats belonging to the Island, and brought to the Battery
without delay. The rest of the people were put in the tugs and the
various kinds of river craft that hurried down the Bay the moment the
fire was discovered.</p>

<p>Some anxiety was felt lest the papers and records of the Immigration
Bureau had been destroyed in the fire, but it was found that most of
them were in safes and had escaped injury.</p>

<p>New buildings will be put up as soon as possible; the work on them will
be begun without delay. This time, however, they will be built of brick
or stone, and not of wood.</p>

<p>Many of our friends have asked us whether Robinson's Crusoe's Island had
really been swallowed up by the sea, according to the report which was
given out, and which we mentioned on pages 243 and 290 of <span class="smcap">The Great
Round World</span>.</p>

<p>To make absolutely sure of the matter, we wrote to Mr. James Dobbs,
United States Consul at Valparaiso, Chile.</p>

<p>He has sent us a very kind letter, which we copy for you here, and with
the letter a picture of one of the ports of the island (see
frontispiece).</p>

<p>You will be glad to know that the report was not <a name="Page_971" id="Page_971"></a>true, and that

<p>Your letter of March 17th was received by last mail, and I take
pleasure in replying that there is not the slightest foundation for
the report that the Island of Juan Fernandez has been swallowed up
by the sea. During the month of April President Err&aacute;zuriz and his
staff made a trip of inspection on one of the Chilean men-of-war to
the island, and spent several days there. A passenger steamer also
made regular trips back and forth from this city during the past
summer (our winter), and the excursionists, upon returning, have
invariably expressed their enjoyment of the trip. You may depend
Robinson Crusoe's old home remains intact, and still inhabited by
goats. I enclose you a copy of the English paper here, containing a
cut of one of the little ports of the island, photographed by

<p>The latest news from Miles City tells us that the two hundred Indians
are still off the Reservation, and that those who remain under
Government control are unruly and hard to manage.</p><p><a name="Page_972" id="Page_972"></a></p>

<p>Settlers continue to bring their families into the city for protection.
The Indians are reported to be riding all over the country in small
parties, destroying everything in their line of march.</p>

<p>So far there has been no bloodshed, but the settlers fear that there
will be if they attempt to check the work of destruction.</p>

<p>The Sheriff has gone again to the Reservation with an order for the
arrest of White Bull. He will probably have some trouble before he lays
hands on the unruly Indian, but there is no doubt that the entire band
will be returned to the Reservation ere long.</p>

<p>Runaway Indians are always obliged to return to their home, as they can
find neither food nor shelter elsewhere, and are sure to suffer if they
do not go back. If they appear at the forts they are captured, and every
white settler knows that the Indians have no business off the government
Reservations, and endeavors to have them driven back where they belong.</p>

<p>The Indians are thus surrounded by enemies, and they can only hope for a
short period of freedom; then they must go back home, and take their
punishment for truancy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Word comes from Mexico that the President, General Diaz, has made a
treaty with a tribe of Indians called the Yaquis, who have defied the
government rule since the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>These people have, for over two hundred years, refused to pay taxes or
obey any laws but their own. They have lived in their own mountainous
country, <a name="Page_973" id="Page_973"></a>and successfully repelled attempts to dislodge them or make
them obey the Mexican laws.</p>

<p>It is said that our troubles with the Indians have been slight when
compared with those of the Mexicans with the Yaquis.</p>

<p>President Diaz, who is half an Indian himself, has at last found a means
of making peace with them.</p>

<p>He has taken a lesson from his experiences in dealing with the brigands,
who at one time infested Mexico.</p>

<p>At first he attempted to conquer these robbers by sending soldiers out
after them; but finding that this plan was a total failure, he adopted
another, which was the old principle of setting a thief to catch a
thief. He offered them pardons if they would enlist in a new body of
guards, which he created. The duties of the regiment were half military
and half police. The President uniformed them, gave them good pay, and
in a very short time found that, instead of numberless bands of
dangerous robbers, he had a fine corps of vigilant thief-catchers.</p>

<p>This experiment having turned out so well, Diaz decided to adopt a
similar plan with the Yaquis.</p>

<p>He offered to enrol them into a militia corps with uniforms and good
pay, and asked them to aid in carrying out the laws.</p>

<p>The Yaquis decided to accept this offer, as they are a race of warriors
who like soldiering, and so the treaty was made.</p>

<p>It is said that the Chief of the Yaquis rode to the conference followed
by eight hundred well-armed warriors. The treaty was made, and the
ceremonies were followed by a great feast, in which Mexicans and Yaquis
both took part.</p><p><a name="Page_974" id="Page_974"></a></p>

<p>It is thought that the making of this treaty will be of great value to
Mexico.</p>

<p>It is also reported that a new volcano has been formed in Mexico, on the
peninsula of Tehuantepec, which is on the southwest coast of Mexico.</p>

<p>Severe earthquake shocks were felt in the region, and finally a new
volcano made its appearance.</p>

<p>No one has as yet visited it, for the Mexicans are too much frightened
to go near, but smoke and fire can be seen coming out of the mountain.</p>

<p>The Government has sent a party out from the City of Mexico to find out
the truth of the matter.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>British India, or Hindostan, has also been suffering from earthquake.</p>

<p>A very severe shock, which lasted nearly five minutes, was felt in
Calcutta on June 12th. The disturbance extended over a large area of
country, and a great deal of damage was done.</p>

<p>In the town of Calcutta the public buildings were damaged, and the
spires of several churches fell. In some parts of the city hardly any of
the houses escaped damage.</p>

<p>Throughout the country, railways were destroyed, bridges broken, and an
immense amount of property ruined. In one place the earth opened, and a
railway train was overturned.</p>

<p>Many people were killed by buildings falling on them, and there was
great terror and distress in all the provinces visited by the
earthquake.</p>

<p>On the same day, word was cabled that a number of British officers and
native soldiers had been <a name="Page_975" id="Page_975"></a>massacred on the Afghanistan frontier, at a
place called the Tochi Valley.</p>

<p>A government officer, Mr. Gee, was travelling through the district under
the escort of a body of troops. The party was attacked by a tribe of
frontiersmen, and the British obliged to retreat, their enemies
following them for several miles.</p>

<p>Some of the officers commanding the troops were killed, and all of them
were wounded.</p>

<p>Mr. Gee had been sent to the frontier to fix the site for a new outpost
or fort, and to collect fines that had been imposed on the frontiersmen
for past misconduct.</p>

<p>The Waziris, as the tribe is called, did not like Mr. Gee's mission, and
so lay in wait for his party, and, when it entered the valley, poured
down from the hills on all sides and in great numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain will send out an expedition to punish the Waziris, but it
is expected that it will take some severe fighting to overcome these
natives.</p>

<p>They are a powerful tribe which can muster about forty thousand fighting
men. They are strong, hardy, and well versed in the use of rifles, and
are constantly fighting the other tribes around them, so that they are
always ready for war.</p>

<p>Their country extends over a vast tract of land, and they are a very
formidable people.</p>

<p>England cannot allow her representatives to be attacked by these people
without punishing them, and however severe the task may be, it is

<p>Of late there has been a good deal of angry talk about the seal
question.</p><p><a name="Page_976" id="Page_976"></a></p>

<p>It is said that the United States has been acting in bad faith, in not
paying Canada the sum of $425,000 for unlawfully keeping her ships out
of the Bering Sea.</p>

<p>It has also been frequently stated that the Seal Arbitration Committee,
which met in Paris in 1893, decided that we must pay this sum. People
are inquiring why we don't pay it before we ask for England's help in
protecting the seals.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the United States does not owe any such sum.</p>

<p>The Paris tribunal said we had no right to prevent other ships from
entering the Bering Sea, and that we must pay damages to Canada for
having done so.</p>

<p>No sum of money was, however, agreed on.</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury and Secretary of State Gresham decided that, "subject to
the approval of Congress," $425,000 would be about a fair sum for us to
pay.</p>

<p>When the subject came up before Congress, it was found that many false
claims were being made, and that frauds of every kind were being
practised to get damages from us. The entire matter was therefore thrown
out, Congress refusing to agree to the payment of the $425,000.</p>

<p>A Committee was appointed to look into the matter, and is now holding
its sittings in Vancouver. At the present time no one knows what amount
we will have to pay.</p>

<p>When the fair and just demand is presented to our Government, there is
no doubt it will be settled without delay.</p>

<p>Mr. John W. Foster has been sent to Europe to try and settle the seal
fisheries dispute.</p><p><a name="Page_977" id="Page_977"></a></p>

<p>He first went to England, but did not meet with success there, so he
journeyed on to St. Petersburg, to see if Russia would not help us.</p>

<p>It is said that he has secured an agreement from Russia and Japan,
whereby they promise to close the Bering Sea seal fisheries for a number
of years.</p>

<p>With this agreement Mr. Foster hopes to convince the British Government
that such action is necessary, and obtain England's consent to the
measure. Closing the seal fisheries means that no seals will be caught
for a certain period.</p>

<p>It is said that the seals are decreasing every year, and that unless
something is done, there will soon be none left in the Bering Sea!</p>

<p>Many weeks ago, when the rumors of trouble in the East between Turkey
and Greece caused us to turn our attention to these countries, we found
that we knew very little about these people, and it was necessary for us
to read about them; then <span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span> published the
story of the "Ottoman Empire in Europe" and afterward the relations
existing between "Crete and Greece"; but these accounts were not
sufficient by themselves; we had to go back further still in order to
understand how all of these things came to be; a step taken further into
the almost forgotten past increased our interest and led us back further
still, and finally the story of "Ancient Greece" was told. Even this was
not sufficient, and we have now made up our minds to begin as nearly <a name="Page_978" id="Page_978"></a>as
possible at the beginning and tell the story of the great-great
grandfathers and grandmothers of these interesting people. This story
will be told by Mme. Ragozin, who has spent so many years in studying
the history of these ancient times.</p>

<p>The first part of this story of "The Great Round World, and the People
Who Lived On It," is given in this number.</p><p><a name="Page_979" id="Page_979"></a></p>

<h2>LETTERS FROM OUR YOUNG FRIENDS.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Dear Editor:</span>

<p>I was ten years old on the 29th of May.</p>

<p>I think <span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span> is fine, and wish it much
success.</p>

<p>I wish it was thicker, so I could read more at a time.</p>

<p>It's too bad about Greece and Turkey's war. Do you think there is
any chance of Greece winning if the Powers stop their foolishness?</p>

<p>My big brother (who is six feet three inches) was down in Jamaica
for a while, and saw a Cuban filibuster and knew the captain of it. </p></div>

<div><span class="smcap">Dear Meredith</span>:</div>

<p>It is very difficult for us to tell anything about Greece and Turkey;
many people think that Greece is entirely out of the whole matter, and
that if the Powers want Turkey to give up Thessaly they will have to
fight her and force her to do so.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>To the Readers of</i> <span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span>.

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Boys and Girls</span>:&mdash;The first part of this letter is for
you little ones whose hunger for "stories" is often unappeased
because of the lack of books suitable for you&mdash;whose ages may be
represented by single figures.</p>

<p>If you are not yet ten years old you will be sure to enjoy "The
Adventures of a Brownie." It is written by Miss Mulock, and is a
delightful tale of a most fascinating Brownie, who lived behind a
piece of coal in a dark cellar, but who ventured out occasionally
to tease, play with, protect, and amuse six merry little people. He
proved to be a kind and <a name="Page_980" id="Page_980"></a>ever welcome friend to them, although he
was often naughty and played sorry tricks on careless people.</p>

<p>"Little Prince Fairyfoot," by Frances Hodgson Burnett, will prove
interesting to all lovers of fairyland, and all who enjoyed
"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" will be sure to like "Davy and
the Goblin," by Charles Carryl.</p>

<p>You girls whose skirts have almost reached the tops of your boots
will find "Mrs. Overtheway's Remembrances," by Mrs. Ewing, very
interesting. "Unknown to History," by Miss Yonge, and "Number
XIII., the Story of the Lost Vestal," by Emma Marshall, are
slightly historical in character, and are stories of absorbing
interest, the one containing old English, and the other old Roman
characters.</p>

<p>For boys of a corresponding age, no book could be found more
enjoyable than "Some Strange Corners of Our Country," by Charles
Lummis. The book is comparatively a new one, and should be read by
every American boy and girl, as it describes some of the curious
customs of our great West, and explains many of the freaks of
Nature in this only partially known "New World."</p>

<p>Mr. McMullin has also been kind enough to send us the rules for
admission to the schoolship. If you will send us your address we will be
pleased to forward them to you.</p>

<p>I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 10th
inst., and in reply would say that the schoolship "<i>St. Mary's</i>" is open
to admission only to boys whose parents reside in New York City, or who
have a guardian appointed here.</p>

<p>The vessel is now at New London, Connecticut, and will leave there about
the 23d inst. for a cruise in foreign waters. No applicant will be
received, however, after the 15th inst.</p>

<p>I am not able to say whether the city of Philadelphia maintains a vessel
similar to ours or not. A letter to the Clerk of the Board of Education

<p>Whales are in many respects the most interesting and wonderful of
creatures. It would seem that at one time they may have been land
creatures, and able to walk on land as other animals do. That is,
however, so very remote that we have no record of it. Scientific men
base their arguments in favor of this theory on the facts that whales
are not true fish, but are indeed land mammals adapted to living in the
water.</p>

<p>Their fore-limbs, though reduced to mere paddles, have all the bones,
joints, and even most of the muscles, nerves, and arteries of the human
arm and hand. The rudiments of hind-legs are found buried deep in the
interior of the animal, and in the young whales bristles about the chin
and upper lip give evidence that the whales have once been covered with
hair like other mammals.</p>

<p>The blubber is also arranged by nature as a means for keeping their
bodies warm. True fishes are cold-blooded animals, and not sensible to
differences of temperature.</p>

<p>All these different facts make people think that at some very remote
period whales were land animals.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT ROUND WORLD AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED ON IT.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>There was once a man who lived with his family on a large farm in a fine
valley sheltered by high mountains. The farm had need to be large, for
the family was numerous. There were the old man's children and
grandchildren, and these again had sons and daughters, and they all
lived together, in many huts, which made a village or town. Of course
they all were more or less nearly related to one another, and all called
the old man father. He was their head and chief&mdash;their king, and his
word, his commands, were their only laws. He was assisted and advised by
the oldest and wisest among the men, who met regularly to discuss the
family's affairs, and formed a sort of senate or council of elders. When
great things had to be talked over and settled, things which interested
everybody alike, the whole family was called together, and had a
mass-meeting after working hours.</p>

<p>The family knew nothing of the great round world but their own farm. In
fact, they did not care whether there was any world outside of their
mountains, because they had no need of any. All they wanted, for food,
clothing, or shelter, they found or raised on <a name="Page_986" id="Page_986"></a>their own land. They had
pure running water to drink and to fish in; woods to hunt in and cut
down for fuel and building timber; meadows for the flocks and herds
which gave them milk and flesh, hides and wool; broad fields stretched
under the sun, green with the tender sprouting crops or golden with the
ripening harvest.</p>

<p>The family had no idea how long they and their forefathers before them
had owned and lived upon the farm. If they ever thought of it at all,
they probably thought they had been there always. Really, it must have
been a very, very long time&mdash;they were so thoroughly settled, so well
acquainted with the land and everything on it; then they were so
numerous and knew so much. It must have taken a tremendous length of
time to learn all about farming and dairy work, about building, and
weaving, and making things,&mdash;to have found out so much about the stars,
the coming and going of the moon, the years and months which it
makes,&mdash;to have so many set customs, and a religion with prayers and
worship,&mdash;and lastly, to have invented writing and no end of useful
arts, requiring skill and long practice.</p>

<p>There came a time when it was no longer a family, but a great many
families, which could not go on living so close together. So they began
to build separate homesteads, all around the old home, but farther and
farther away from it. They went on living exactly in the same way, only
each new homestead had its own head. The tie of blood was strong and the
separated families kept it sacred, even if they quarrelled now and then,
as neighbors and relatives will at times.</p><p><a name="Page_987" id="Page_987"></a></p>

<p>At last the valley became too crowded. There was no longer enough of
everything for all, so that quarrelling and even fighting grew almost
into a habit; the heads of families and the wise elders did their best
to keep the peace, but were not much listened to. At the same time the
younger people were beginning to wonder what there was on the other side
of the mountains. Once in a while a huntsman, in the excitement of
following his game, would climb to some high point, from which he would
look down into other valleys, with more mountains beyond. Then he would
take up some comrade with him, and they would stand there long, gazing
and wondering. Then some of the bolder, more curious boys and youths had
followed the river into the narrow passage it had broken for itself
through the mountains. The first who ventured had not gone very far.
They had felt dreadfully frightened and lonesome in that dark, wild
pass, between the two rugged rocky walls, so high that they seemed to
join at the top, showing only a little strip of blue sky, and with the
water foaming and roaring deep down below, and they had been glad to get
back into the safety and sunshine of their own valley. But they had gone
again, many together, and got farther,&mdash;for many will be brave where one
is scared,&mdash;and it became known for a positive fact that there was a way
out of the valley. Of course there was much curiosity to know whither it
led and what the land on the other side might be like.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that some young families, who were going to set up
new homesteads of their own, instead of crowding into some of the
scantily measured lots of poor soil which were all that was left in the
<a name="Page_988" id="Page_988"></a>valley, collected the household goods and the domestic animals which
were their due share of the community's property, and started off
through the mountain pass, following the river. They were never heard of
more.</p>

<p>Others did the same. And still others, again and again. It was like bees
swarming. From time to time children, brothers, cousins said good-by and
went. None ever came back. None ever were heard from. All that was known
of them was that they did not all go the same way. Some went west, and
some south; and some northwest or southwest. And they never met or heard
from one another, either. They became and remained total strangers; did
not even know of one another's existence. But all treasured memories of
the old home&mdash;the latest gone, of course, more than those that went
first, who naturally forgot most in the course of time.</p>

<p>The years went by&mdash;many hundreds of years; and great changes came over
the world and the people that lived in it. They who used to keep much to
themselves and look on one another with distrust and dislike were
brought together in many ways; they made war, they traded, they
travelled, and, either as friends or foes, learned to know and take
interest in one another. What struck people most at first was how
different they were, in looks and in manners, in mind and in language.
Some were dark and some very fair; some quick and fierce, others slow
and persistent. Those who lived in the South, where the sun is seldom
clouded and the sea is bluer than the sky, were fond of all bright
things, loved luxury and ease; those whose homes were in the North,
where sad, dark <a name="Page_989" id="Page_989"></a>woods sigh in the wind, where lanes and fields are
wrapped in mists and snow half the year, were themselves sad and dreamy,
rough of manner, but strong of heart.</p>

<p>But if people from different countries wondered at the differences
between them, they began to make other discoveries as they were brought
together more often and more closely.</p>

<p>There had been a great storm. A ship was wrecked and the pieces were
carried away on the dancing waves. Almost all the sailors were drowned;
only a few had been thrown out on the beach alive and taken in by poor
fishermen. They were sad and lonely, for they could not understand their
hosts and had no hope of being picked up soon by another ship of their
own country, it was so far away. To while away the time and to feel less
strange among the people, they began to learn the language, asking the
names of things as they went. Fancy how astonished they were when they
found out, as the sounds of the foreign words grew more familiar, that
the names of most things in common use were almost the same as in their
own language, also a great many of the most ordinary words: just a
letter or two changed, or a little difference in the way of
pronouncing&mdash;as, for instance, <i>mleko</i> for <i>milk</i>, <i>sestra</i> for
<i>sister</i>, <i>tre</i> or <i>drei</i> for <i>three</i>, and so on, sometimes more like,
sometimes less. And there were more surprises in store for the guests.
When they had made progress enough to understand a great deal, they took
much pleasure in listening to the songs which the women sang to the
small children and the stories they told to the older ones. And these
stories were not new to them! They were the same <a name="Page_990" id="Page_990"></a>songs and stories that
had been used for years by their mothers and grandmothers to amuse the
children, and had always been known in the country. There was the little
girl and the wolf, and the sleeping beauty, and the wicked stepmother,
and the girl whom the prince knew by her tiny foot, and many, many more.
The shipwrecked guests wondered much, and at last came to the conclusion
that they and their hosts were distant cousins; for they remembered
hearing from some aged men that they were themselves descended from a
branch of a very old family&mdash;one of many which at different times left
the old stock, long, long ago, and now, surely, here were the
descendants of another branch.</p>

<p>Another time, and in another country, there had been a great battle. A
brave army, led by a famous general, had come into a rich and powerful
country, to make its people subject to their own king. But the people,
too, were brave; besides, they fought for their liberty and their homes,
and that made them doubly strong. They had driven the enemy from before
their capital city after an obstinate siege and had made many prisoners.
Both nations were civilized and enlightened; therefore there was no bad
feeling after the fighting was over, and the prisoners were treated more
like guests, waiting for the signing of the treaty of peace, when they
would be exchanged. The sick and the wounded were taken care of at the
hospitals; as to the others, the private soldiers were placed in
well-kept barracks, and the officers were quartered in private families
and left free "<i>on parole</i>," <i>i.e.</i>, on their promise not to try to
escape. Friendships were formed, and the unwilling guests employed their
forced leisure <a name="Page_991" id="Page_991"></a>in studying the customs, laws, and society of the nation
into which they were thus thrown. There were highly cultivated and
scholarly men among the captive officers; yet they were naturally a
little prejudiced, so that they were not a little astonished when they
found the customs and laws not only not inferior to their own, but in
many cases almost exactly the same. More than that, they continually
came upon little habits, sayings, even superstitious customs at births,
weddings, funerals, and other occasions, which they had been familiar
with at home from childhood, and which they had been told by nurses and
old servants should be observed and respected because they were family
peculiarities, handed down from times so ancient nobody could have
counted the years. Still greater was the astonishment of those who
discovered that a great many of the religious ceremonies, prayers,
hymns, which were held particularly sacred in their native country for
the same reason, were observed and treasured with only slight
differences by those whom they had always looked upon as the merest
strangers. When the holy books and the sacred laws of both nations, also
the stories of favorite ancient heroes, were found to be so much alike
that it was clear they were all heirlooms from the same family treasure,
no more proof was needed for those who had so recently fought&mdash;and might
fight again any time&mdash;to say: "We are kin; years and years ago, our
fathers were brothers and lived in one common home."</p>

<p>It was not in one place, or two, or three, that such discoveries were
made, but in many and all over the world. For after chance had led to
the first, people became interested and began to look for forgotten
<a name="Page_992" id="Page_992"></a>kindred to turn up. The well-known signs were watched, and compared,
and verified, till nowadays no one doubts that the descendants of the
families who once upon a time recklessly migrated from the
long-forgotten valley are scattered over the face of the earth and can
know one another by the token of their languages, their customs,
stories, songs, their sacred legends and laws.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What family is this whose history we have briefly sketched? Is it a real
family, and a true history? Or is it just a "made-up" story, the fancy
of an idle moment? No: the history <i>is</i> a true one, and it is the
history of a real family&mdash;the family to which we all belong, and the
name of which is&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mankind</span>.</p>

<h2>"The Great Round World" PRIZE CONTEST</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The Great Round World</span> is now over six months old, and it feels
some anxiety to know just how much interest its readers have taken in
the news and how much information they have gained from its pages. To
ascertain this, it has been decided to offer ten prizes for the best
answers to the following:</p>

<div class='center'><span class='u'><b>Name ten of the most important events that have been mentioned in "The
Great Round World" in the first 30 numbers, that is, up to number of
June 3d.</b></span></div>

<div class='center'><i>In mentioning these events give briefly reasons for considering them
important.</i></div>

<p>This competition will be open to subscribers only, and any one desiring
to enter the competition must send to this office their name and the
date of their subscription; a number will then be given them.</p>

<p>All new subscribers will be furnished with a card entitling them to
enter the competition.</p>

<p>In making the selection of important events, remember that wars and
political events are not necessarily the most important. If, for
instance, the air-ship had turned out to be a genuine and successful
thing, it would have been most important as affecting the history of the
world. Or if by chance the telephone or telegraph had been invented in
this period, these inventions would have been <i>important</i> events.</p>

<p>Prizes will be awarded to those who make the best selection and who
mention the events in the best order of their importance. Answers may be
sent in any time before September 1st.</p>

<p>The Great Round World does not want you to hurry over this contest, but
to take plenty of time and do the work carefully. It will be a pleasant
occupation for the summer months.</p>

<p>We would advise you to take the magazines starting at No. 1, look them
over carefully, keep a note-book at your side, and jot down in it the
events that seem to you important; when you have finished them all, No.
1 to 30, look over your notes and select the ten events that seem to you
to be the most important, stating after each event your reason for
thinking it important.</p>

<p>For instance: suppose you decide that the death of Dr. Ruiz was one of
these important events, you might say, "The killing of Dr. Ruiz in the
prison of Guanabacoa&mdash;because it brought the cruelties practised on
American citizens to the attention of our Government," etc., etc.</p>

<p>In sending your answers put your number and the date only on them, for
the judges are not to know names and addresses of the contestants, that
there may be no favoritism shown.</p>

<p>It is important to put date on, for if two or more are found of similar
standing, the one first received will be given preference.</p>

<p>Address all letters to REVIEW PRIZE CONTEST DEPARTMENT,
<span class="smcap">Great Round World</span>, 3 and 5 West 18th Street, New York City.</p>

<p>John Jackson, the originator of this system of vertical writing, is the
only teacher who has had the years of practice in teaching it that make
these the standard manuals for teachers and students. The adoption of
vertical writing abroad and in this country is largely due to his
persistent work and the marvellous results of his teaching. His series of
copy-books were the first to be used in this country, and are considered
by experienced teachers, who are not to be misled by mere beauty of
engravers work, to contain the only practical well-graded course of
instruction leading from primary work to the rapid and now justly
celebrated <b>telegraph hand</b>&mdash;for these books are the only ones containing
copies in this rapid writing. The telegraph hand is the style used by the
best telegraph operators in the country&mdash;and these writers are universally
acknowledged to be the most rapid writers, and writers of a hand which of
necessity must be most legible.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
